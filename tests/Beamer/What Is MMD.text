# MultiMarkdown is a derivative of Markdown #

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)  is a  program and  a
syntax by John Gruber  that allows you to easily convert  plain text into HTML
suitable for using on a web page.


# The old way was complicated #

	<p>In order to create valid 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, you 
	need properly coded syntax that can be cumbersome for 
	&#8220;non-programmers&#8221; to write. Sometimes, you
	just want to easily make certain words <strong>bold
	</strong>, and certain words <em>italicized</em> without
	having to remember the syntax. Additionally, for example,
	creating lists:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>should be easy</li>
	<li>should not involve programming</li>
	</ul>


# The new way is easier #

	In order to create valid [HTML], you need properly
	coded syntax that can be cumbersome for 
	"non-programmers" to write. Sometimes, you just want
	to easily make certain words **bold**, and certain 
	words *italicized* without having to remember the 
	syntax. Additionally, for example, creating lists:

	* should be easy
	* should not involve programming

# Markdown is designed for people #

The overriding design  goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is  to make it as
readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be
publishable as-is,  as plain text,  without looking  like it's been  marked up
with  tags  or  formatting  instructions. While  Markdown's  syntax  has  been
influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source
of  inspiration for  Markdown's  syntax is  the format  of  plain text  email.

# But Markdown wasn't complete #

I, and  others, loved  the spirit and  elegance of Markdown,  but felt  it was
still  missing a  few  features that  each of  us  considered were  essential.
Several  variations  on Markdown  arose  to  meet  the  needs of  these  other
programmers.


# MultiMarkdown adds several new features #

* footnotes
* tables
* citations and bibliography
* image attributes
* metadata
* internal cross-references
* math support
* glossary entries
* definition lists
* and more...


# MMD also adds something else... #

* Outside of the actual syntax, MMD supports multiple output formats,
  including HTML, [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX),
  [OpenDocument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument), and
  [OPML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML)

* This allows you to use the same markup language (MultiMarkdown) to create a
  high quality pdf (article, book, or presentation like this one) without any
  additional programming.

* Most importantly, you don't have to know how this works, or even what
  the LaTeX commands mean --- just have the software installed.


# So, one text file becomes multiple final documents #


![Example MultiMarkdown output formats](OPML-MMD-Map.pdf)


# The goal is to separate content from formatting #

By  focusing on  the text  content  of your  document,  you can  focus on  the
creative, the scientific, the *human*. Let your computer do what it is good at
---  the fairly  boring job  of  making sure  that margins  are correct,  that
paragraphs are properly separated, your footnotes  are in order, and that your
tables line up  --- regardless of the  final format you want  your document to
take.


# MultiMarkdown and Mathematics #

Built  into MultiMarkdown  is support  for mathematical  equations. You  write
using   LaTeX   syntax.    When   you   output   to   HTML,    you   can   use
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) to properly display the math. If you output
to LaTeX, it  is display automatically. There is not  currently an approach to
display math using OpenDocument

	\\[ {e}^{i\pi }+1=0 \\]

becomes

\\[ {e}^{i\pi }+1=0 \\]


# Images are just as easy #

becomes...

# Support for a bibliography is also included #

* MultiMarkdown has support for [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/ "BibTeX"), or
  for just including your own citations, so that you can back up your
  arguments.[p. 42][#fake]

* The citation above links to the corresponding entry in the bibliography.

# Installation is easy #

* Download the MultiMarkdown software --- there are installers for Mac OS X
  and Windows, and instructions for compiling in Linux.

* If you want to use LaTeX, install a version appropriate for your operating
  system.

* OpenDocument output doesn't require any special software, but will require
  an application capable of opening the document --- LibreOffice,
  OpenOffice.org (with the proper plug-in installed), etc.


# How do I create a MultiMarkdown document? #

* A MultiMarkdown is simply a text document that is written in the
  MultiMarkdown syntax. You can use any text editor or application you like.
  If your editor supports fonts, italics, etc. then be sure to save as a plain
  text file (not a .doc, RTF, or other "rich" format).

* Some applications include built-in support for MultiMarkdown in various
  ways. There's a [bundle][] for [TextMate][], and [Scrivener][] includes
  MultiMarkdown support.

# Why should I mess with this LaTeX stuff? #

MultiMarkdown's support for LaTeX is  designed to automatically do the "right"
thing in most situations for most people. But  if you want to dig in and learn
more, you can customize MMD to create highly tailored documents that suit your
specific needs. If you  want high quality typography, LaTeX is  the way to go.

If you  already know what  LaTeX is, then  MultiMarkdown allows you  to create
documents without learning all of the complicated LaTeX commands and markup.


# How do I create a fancy PDF? #

If you're using LaTeX, and have the proper software installed it's easy:

1. Type `mmd2tex filename.txt`

2. Use `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, or your preferred tool to compile the LaTeX 
   file into a pdf.

3. There is no step 3

# By the way... #

This presentation  was, of course,  written in MultiMarkdown and  processed by
typing `mmd2tex what_is_mmd.txt`.

It uses the `beamer` XSLT file, and the `keynote-gradient` beamer theme.
