# mmd2pdf --- MultiMarkdown convenience script

#
# Pass arguments on to the binary to convert text to LaTeX
# Then use latexmk to process into PDF.
# Requires a few extra passes of pdflatex to be sure all autorefs
# 	are managed.
# Then call latexmk with -c option to try and clean up some extra files.
#
#	NOTE: This file is included as a convenience for users - it's not 
#		likely to fail gracefully if there are any issues in your
#		LaTeX file.

# Be sure to include multimarkdown and latex in our PATH
