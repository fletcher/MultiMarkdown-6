<h3 id="introduction">Introduction </h3>

<p>Version: 6.0.0-rc1</p>

<p>This document serves as a description of MultiMarkdown (<abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr>) v6, as well as a sample
document to demonstrate the various features. Specifically, differences from
<abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v5 will be pointed out.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance </h3>

<p>A big motivating factor leading to the development of <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 was
performance. When <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> first migrated from Perl to C (based on <a href="https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown">peg-
markdown</a>), it was among the fastest
Markdown parsers available. That was many years ago, and the &#8220;competition&#8221;
has made a great deal of progress since that time.</p>

<p>When developing <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6, one of my goals was to keep <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> at least in the
ballpark of the fastest processors. Of course, being <em>the</em> fastest would be
fantastic, but I was more concerned with ensuring that the code was easily
understood, and easily updated with new features in the future.</p>

<p><abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v3 &#8211; v5 used a <a href="#gn:1" id="gnref:1" title="see glossary" class="glossary">PEG</a> to handle the parsing. This made it easy to
understand the relationship between the <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> grammar and the parsing code,
since they were one and the same. However, the parsing code generated by
the parsers was not particularly fast, and was prone to troublesome edge
cases with terrible performance characteristics.</p>

<p>The first step in <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 parsing is to break the source text into a series
of tokens, which may consist of plain text, whitespace, or special characters
such as &#8216;*&#8217;, &#8216;[&#8217;, etc. This chain of tokens is then used to perform the
actual parsing.</p>

<p><abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 divides the parsing into two separate phases, which actually fits
more with Markdown&#8217;s design philosophically.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Block parsing consists of identifying the &#8220;type&#8221; of each line of the
source text, and grouping the lines into blocks (e.g. paragraphs, lists,
blockquotes, etc.) Some blocks are a single line (e.g. ATX headers), and
others can be many lines long. The block parsing in <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 is handled
by a parser generated by <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/">lemon</a>. This
parser allows the block structure to be more readily understood by
non-programmers, but the generated parser is still fast.</p></li>
<li><p>Span parsing consists of identifying Markdown/<abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> structures that occur
inside of blocks, such as links, images, strong, emph, etc. Most of these
structures require matching pairs of tokens to specify where the span starts
and where it ends. Most of these spans allow arbitrary levels of nesting as
well. This made parsing them correctly in the <a href="#gn:1" title="see glossary" class="glossary">PEG</a>-based code difficult and
slow. <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 uses a different approach that is accurate and has good
performance characteristics even with edge cases. Basically, it keeps a stack
of each &#8220;opening&#8221; token as it steps through the token chain. When a &#8220;closing&#8221;
token is found, it is paired with the most recent appropriate opener on the
stack. Any tokens in between the opener and closer are removed, as they are
not able to be matched any more. To avoid unnecessary searches for non-
existent openers, the parser keeps track of which opening tokens have been
discovered. This allows the parser to continue moving forwards without having
to go backwards and re-parse any previously visited tokens.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The result of this redesigned <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> parser is that it can parse short
documents more quickly than <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>, and takes
only 15% &#8211; 20% longer to parse long documents. I have not delved too deeply
into this, but I presume that CommonMark has a bit more &#8220;set-up&#8221; time that
becomes expensive when parsing a short document (e.g. a paragraph or two). But
this cost becomes negligible when parsing longer documents (e.g. file sizes of
1 MB). So depending on your use case, CommonMark may well be faster than
<abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr>, but we&#8217;re talking about splitting hairs here&#8230;. Recent comparisons
show <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 taking approximately 4.37 seconds to parse a 108 MB file
(approximately 24.8 MB/second), and CommonMark took 3.72 seconds for the same
file (29.2 MB/second). For comparison, <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v5.4 took approximately 94
second for the same file (1.15 MB/second).</p>

<p>For a more realistic file of approx 28 kb (the source of the Markdown Syntax
web page), both <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> and CommonMark parse it too quickly to accurately
measure. In fact, it requires a file consisting of the original file copied
32 times over (0.85 MB) before <code>/usr/bin/env time</code> reports a time over the
minimum threshold of 0.01 seconds for either program.</p>

<p>There is still potentially room for additional optimization in <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr>.
However, even if I can&#8217;t close the performance gap with CommonMark on longer
files, the additional features of <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> compared with Markdown in addition to
the increased legibility of the source code of <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> (in my biased opinion
anyway) make this project worthwhile.</p>

<h3 id="parsetree">Parse Tree </h3>

<p><abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 performs its parsing in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start with a null-terminated string of source text (C style string)</p></li>
<li><p>Lex string into token chain</p></li>
<li><p>Parse token chain into blocks</p></li>
<li><p>Parse tokens within each block into span level structures (e.g. strong,
emph, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Export the token tree into the desired output format (e.g. HTML, LaTeX,
etc.) and return the resulting C style string</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Use the resulting token tree for your own purposes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The token tree (<a href="#gn:2" id="gnref:2" title="see glossary" class="glossary">AST</a>) includes starting offsets and length of each token,
allowing you to use <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> as part of a syntax highlighter. <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v5 did not
have this functionality in the public version, in part because the <a href="#gn:1" title="see glossary" class="glossary">PEG</a> parsers
used did not provide reliable offset positions, requiring a great deal of
effort when I adapted <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> for use in <a href="http://multimarkdown.com/">MultiMarkdown
Composer</a>.</p>

<p>These steps are managed using the <code>mmd_engine</code> &#8220;object&#8221;. An individual
<code>mmd_engine</code> cannot be used by multiple threads simultaneously, so if
libMultiMarkdown is to be used in a multithreaded program, a separate
<code>mmd_engine</code> should be created for each thread. Alternatively, just use the
slightly more abstracted <code>mmd_convert_string()</code> function that handles creating
and destroying the <code>mmd_engine</code> automatically.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features </h3>

<h4 id="abbreviationsoracronyms">Abbreviations (Or Acronyms) </h4>

<p>This file includes the use of <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> as an abbreviation for MultiMarkdown. The
abbreviation will be expanded on the first use, and the shortened form will be
used on subsequent occurrences.</p>

<p>Abbreviations can be specified using inline or reference syntax. The inline
variant requires that the abbreviation be wrapped in parentheses and
immediately follows the <code>&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[>MMD] is an abbreviation.  So is [>(MD) Markdown].

[>MMD]: MultiMarkdown
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a &#8220;shortcut&#8221; method for abbreviations that is similar to the
approach used in prior versions of <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr>. You specify the definition for the
abbreviation in the usual manner, but <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> will automatically identify each
instance where the abbreviation is used and substitute it automatically. In
this case, the abbreviation is limited to a more basic character set which
includes letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens, but not much else. For more
complex abbreviations, you must explicitly mark uses of the abbreviation.</p>

<h4 id="citations">Citations </h4>

<p>Citations can be specified using an inline syntax, just like inline footnotes.</p>

<h4 id="criticmarkup">CriticMarkup </h4>

<p><abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 has improved support for <a href="http://criticmarkup.com/">CriticMarkup</a>, both in terms of parsing, and
in terms of support for each output format. You can <ins>insert text</ins>,
<del>delete text</del>, substitute <del>one thing</del><ins>for another</ins>, <mark>highlight text</mark>,
and <span class="critic comment">leave comments</span> in the text.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t specify any command line options, then <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> will apply special
formatting to the CriticMarkup formatting as in the preceding paragraph.
Alternatively, you can use the <code>-a\--accept</code> or <code>-r\--reject</code> options to cause
<abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> to accept or reject, respectively, the proposed changes within the CM
markup. When doing this, CM will work across blank lines. Without either of
these two options, then CriticMarkup that spans a blank line is not recognized
as such. I working on options for this for the future.</p>

<h4 id="emphandstrong">Emph and Strong </h4>

<p>The basics of emphasis and strong emphasis are unchanged, but the parsing
engine has been improved to be more accurate, particularly in various edge
cases where proper parsing can be difficult.</p>

<h4 id="epub3support">EPUB 3 Support </h4>

<p><abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 now provides support for direct creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">EPUB 3</a> files. Previously
a separate tool was required to create EPUB files from <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr>. It&#8217;s now built-
in. Currently, EPUB 3 files are built using the usual HTML 5 output. No
extra CSS is applied, so the default from the reader will be used. Images are
not yet supported, but are planned for the future.</p>

<p>EPUB files can be highly customized with other tools, and I recommend doing
that for production quality files. For example, apparently performance is
improved when the content is divided into multiple files (e.g. one file per
chapter). <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> creates EPUB 3 files using a single file. Tools like <a href="https://sigil-ebook.com/">Sigil</a>
are useful for improving your EPUB files, and I recommend doing that.</p>

<p>Not all EPUB readers support v3 files. I don&#8217;t plan on adding support for
older versions of the EPUB format, but other tools can convert to other
document formats you need. Same goes for Amazon&#8217;s ebook formats &#8211; the
<a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> program can also be used to interconvert between formats.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Because EPUB documents are binary files, <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> only creates them when
run in batch mode (using the <code>-b\--batch</code> options). Otherwise, it simply
outputs the HTML 5 file that would serve as the primary content for the EPUB.</p>

<h4 id="fencedcodeblocks">Fenced Code Blocks </h4>

<p>Fenced code blocks are fundamentally the same as <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v5, except:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The leading and trailing fences can be 3, 4, or 5 backticks in length. That
should be sufficient to account for complex documents without requiring a more
complex parser.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no trailing fence, then everything after the leading fence is
considered to be part of the code block.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="glossaryterms">Glossary Terms </h4>

<p>If there are terms in your document you wish to define in a <a href="#gn:3" id="gnref:3" title="see glossary" class="glossary">glossary</a> at
the end of your document, you can define them using the glossary syntax.</p>

<p>Glossary terms can be specified using inline or reference syntax. The inline
variant requires that the abbreviation be wrapped in parentheses and
immediately follows the <code>?</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[?(glossary) The glossary collects information about important
terms used in your document] is a glossary term.

[?glossary] is also a glossary term.

[?glossary]: The glossary collects information about important
terms used in your document
</code></pre>

<p>Much like abbreviations, there is also a &#8220;shortcut&#8221; method that is similar to
the approach used in prior versions of <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr>. You specify the definition for
the glossary term in the usual manner, but <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> will automatically identify
each instance where the term is used and substitute it automatically. In this
case, the term is limited to a more basic character set which includes
letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens, but not much else. For more complex
glossary terms, you must explicitly mark uses of the term.</p>

<h4 id="internationalization">Internationalization </h4>

<p><abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 includes support for substituting certain text phrases in other
languages. This only affects the HTML format.</p>

<h4 id="metadata">Metadata </h4>

<p>Metadata in <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6 includes new support for LaTeX &#8211; the <code>latex config</code> key
allows you to automatically setup of multiple <code>latex include</code> files at once.
The default setups that I use would typically consist of one LaTeX file to be
included at the top of the file, one to be included right at the beginning of
the document, and one to be included at the end of the document. If you want
to specify the latex files separately, you can use <code>latex leader</code>, <code>latex
begin</code>, and <code>latex footer</code>.</p>

<h4 id="tableofcontents">Table of Contents </h4>

<p>By placing <code>{{TOC}}</code> in your document, you can insert an automatically
generated Table of Contents in your document. As of <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> v6, the native
Table of Contents functionality is used when exporting to LaTeX or
OpenDocument formats.</p>

<h3 id="futuresteps">Future Steps </h3>

<p>Some features I plan to implement at some point:</p>

<ol>
<li>OPML export support is not available in v6. I plan on adding improved
support for this at some point. I was hoping to be able to re-use the
existing v6 parser but it might be simpler to use the approach from v5 and
earlier, which was to have a separate parser tuned to only identify headers
and &#8220;stuff between headers&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
