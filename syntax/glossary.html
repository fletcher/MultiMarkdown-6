<h3 id="glossaries">Glossaries</h3>

<p>MultiMarkdown has a feature that allows footnotes to be specified as glossary terms. It doesn&#8217;t do much for XHTML documents, but the XSLT file that converts the document into LaTeX is designed to convert these special footnotes into glossary entries.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The syntax for glossary terms changed in MultiMarkdown (<abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr>) v6.</p>

<p>If there are terms in your document you wish to define in a <a href="#gn:1" id="gnref:1" title="see glossary" class="glossary">glossary</a> at the end of your document, you can define them using the glossary syntax.</p>

<p>Glossary terms can be specified using inline or reference syntax. The inline variant requires that the abbreviation be wrapped in parentheses and immediately follows the <code>?</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[?(glossary) The glossary collects information about important
terms used in your document] is a glossary term.

[?glossary] is also a glossary term.

[?glossary]: The glossary collects information about important
terms used in your document
</code></pre>

<p>Much like abbreviations, there is also a &#8220;shortcut&#8221; method that is similar to the approach used in prior versions of <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr>. You specify the definition for the glossary term in the usual manner, but <abbr title="MultiMarkdown">MMD</abbr> will automatically identify each instance where the term is used and substitute it automatically. In this case, the term is limited to a more basic character set which includes letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens, but not much else. For more complex glossary terms, you must explicitly mark uses of the term.</p>

<h4 id="latexglossaries">LaTeX Glossaries</h4>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Getting glossaries to work is a slightly more advanced LaTeX
feature, and might take some trial and error the first few times.</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it takes an extra step to generate the glossary when creating a
pdf from a latex file:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You need to have the <code>basic.gst</code> file installed, which comes with the
memoir class.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to run a special makeindex command to generate the <code>.glo</code> file:
<code>makeindex -s `kpsewhich basic.gst` -o &quot;filename.gls&quot; &quot;filename.glo&quot;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Then you run the usual pdflatex command again a few times.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the code below to create an engine file for TeXShop (it belongs in <code>~/Library/TeXShop/Engines</code>). You can name it something like <code>MemoirGlossary.engine</code>. Then, when processing a file that needs a glossary, you typeset your document once with this engine, and then continue to process it normally with the usual LaTeX engine. Your glossary should be compiled appropriately. If you use <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/" title="TeXShop Homepage">TeXShop</a>, this is the way to go.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/	

set path = ($path /usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current 
	/usr/local/bin) # This is actually a continuation of the line above

set basefile = `basename &quot;$1&quot; .tex`

makeindex -s `kpsewhich basic.gst` -o &quot;${basefile}.gls&quot; &quot;${basefile}.glo&quot;
</code></pre>
